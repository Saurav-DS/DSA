LeetCode 542 - 01 Matrix
Difficulty: Medium
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/01-matrix/

Problem:
Given an m x n binary matrix mat, return a matrix where each cell contains 
the distance to the nearest 0. The distance between adjacent cells is 1.

Approach:
- Perform a Multi-Source Breadth-First Search (BFS).
- Initialize a queue with all cells containing 0 and mark them as visited.
- For each cell dequeued, explore its 4-directional neighbors (up, down, left, right).
- If a neighbor has not been visited, set its distance as current cell's distance + 1,
  mark it as visited, and enqueue it.
- Continue until all reachable cells are processed.

Complexity:
- Time Complexity: O(m * n), since each cell is visited once.
- Space Complexity: O(m * n), for the visited array and queue.

Notes:
- Uses a boolean visited matrix to ensure each cell is processed only once.
- Runtime may vary slightly (around 12â€“13 ms) depending on Java memory handling.
